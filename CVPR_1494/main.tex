\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This document presents a comprehensive peer review of the paper "Show and Segment: Universal Medical Image Segmentation via In-Context Learning" submitted to CVPR 2025. Our five-member review team has evaluated the paper across multiple dimensions including technical contribution, experimental methodology, results validation, literature coverage, and presentation quality. We find that while the paper presents a novel and technically sound approach to medical image segmentation through in-context learning, there are several areas requiring clarification and improvement. Our consensus recommendation is Major Revision, contingent upon addressing the identified concerns regarding statistical validation, code availability, and performance analysis on challenging novel classes.
