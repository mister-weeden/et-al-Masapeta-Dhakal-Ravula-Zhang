## 📊 Key Findings

### ✅ Strengths
- **Novel Architecture**: Innovative dual-stream task encoding with decoupled inference
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Testing across 12 diverse medical imaging datasets
- **Computational Efficiency**: Significant improvement over existing methods (2.0s vs 659.4s)
- **3D Processing**: Native volumetric processing unlike 2D-based competitors

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement
- **Novel Class Performance**: Limited performance on challenging cases (28.28% on MSD Pancreas)
- **Domain Shift Robustness**: Significant degradation on extreme domain shifts (47.78% on CSI-fat)
- **Code Availability**: Missing repository link limits reproducibility
- **Statistical Validation**: Needs more rigorous statistical analysis

### 🎯 Recommendation
**Major Revision** - The paper presents valuable contributions but requires addressing key limitations in novel class adaptation and providing better statistical validation.
